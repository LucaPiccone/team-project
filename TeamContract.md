# Team Contract

---
## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project. We will also use the contract for the end of semester peer evaluation.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* Our team will mainly use Instagram for communication outside of class. 

* Each teammate agrees to respond to messages in at most 1 day. In urgent situations (ex. upcoming deadline), teammates should be ready to answer in less than 1 day (or as soon of possible to confirm reception).

* Team members should notify each other about any absences to lecture/lab. They should also let each other know about difficulties in completing assigned tasks (preferably early on so we can work on re-assigning).

* Members should be transparent about schedules. If someone is having a busy week, they should let the team know in advance for accommodations. 

* All communication will remain respectful, professional, and constructive.


---
### Attendance & Participation
* Members will attend all scheduled classes and team meetings unless illness or emergencies occur.

* If unable to attend, a member must notify the team in advance and provide input asynchronously.

* Members should be absent for no more than 2 lectures/labs. 

* During team activities, every member will contribute ideas and engage in the discussion
---
### Work Quality
* All deliverables should be completed on time, tested, and meet the agreed quality standard.

* If an assigned task can't be met, members should let the rest of the team know ASAP so the team can re-assign tasks. 

* Members agree to review each other’s work constructively before submission.

* Each Pull Request will be reviewed by at least two team members.

---

## Decision Making

* Decisions will be made by consensus when possible.

* If consensus cannot be reached, a vote will be taken; majority rules.


---
## Conflict resolution

* If conflict arises:

  * The team will first attempt to resolve the issue privately through open discussion.

  * If the issue persists, the team will involve a member of the course teaching team as mediator.
---

## Accountability

* Persistent non-participation or failure to meet expectations may result in lower peer evaluation scores.

* All members agree to provide honest and fair peer evaluations.
